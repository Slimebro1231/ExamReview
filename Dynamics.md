So exam prep! Fun.
The major thing that we need to be wary of is Dynamics
The major sub-topics under Dynamics are:
[[Kinematics]]
[[Forces]]
[[Energy]]
[[Momentum]]
Click into them to review further. These topics are really interlinked though, so we have to start somewhere. This would be [[Kinematics]]

Also, since there are 8 short answer questions, we will give 2-3 to the rest of physics, which leaves ~6 questions for Dynamics. 
This could result in questions being focused like this:
1. Kinematics (projectile motion)
2. Forces (Blocks sliding)
3. Energy (Roller Coaster)
4. Head-On Collisions
5. "Plane landing" type questions
6. Field involved questions
It is really funny, as progressing down the list, the questions are not solely focused on the prospective units, but involve all of the ideas from previous questions, making the format a lot like waterloo's contests.

So really, the "importance" list looks something like this:
>Kinematics
>>Forces
>>>Energy
>>>>Collisions
>>>>>Fields
