So the exam is "divided" into two parts, dynamics and the rest, which is relatively speaking less important. The exam format, as posted on bright-space is consisted of 45 multiple choice questions and 8 full solution questions.

8 full solution questions, I am guessing are quite mixed, perhaps with 4-6 questions for the major units, and 2-4 questions that combine the rest.
