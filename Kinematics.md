So kinematics would e the fundamental of all the units in dynamics, especially the big 5, which are arguably the most important formulas to remember here. They are provided in the exam, but it is important to remember how to use them. 
The two ones that I personally recommend to remember even though they are on the exam is:

$$displacement = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
This formula is based off the idea of reading and interpreting [[Graphs]]. 
The other formula is:
$$v^2={v_0}^2+2ad$$

Another REALLY important concept is [[Reference Frames]], which will get used super much in the future.

As the utter foundation of the following units, I think that kinematics really just emphasizes on the idea of [[vector components]],  and the use of a vector. To do well in the dynamics section, you have to be able to manipulate vectors, which means changing [[Reference Frames]], ignoring components, and such. You will see more of this later. 

For now, in kinematics, the two major type of questions that are involved is projectile motion and relative motion. Although, relative motion would likely be merging other units, and focused around [[Reference Frames]] or [[vector components]], just in a different way. 

So take a look at [[vector components]], and continue.

With such an idea that the vectors are independent, both of these kinematics questions become extremely simple. Both types essentially recommend the student to split the vector into an x and a y component. After doing so, one of the components won't be affected at all. 

This "unaffected" component is typically used to determine distance, or time. In the case of projectile motion, the y component is affected by gravity, and is used to determine the time the object spends in the air, while the x component, along with the "time" component from the last part of the question is used to find the horizontal distance that travelled. 

Speaking of projectile motion, another thing that is really important is [[symmetry]], which will get brought up in [[Graphs]] as well. In the case of projectile motion. 

If you throw something up in the air, the motion that it takes for the object to travel up in the air is **Exactly** the opposite as it takes to travel down. 
This means, if you know how long it takes for the ball to leave your hand and reach the peak, you know how long it will spend falling back into your hand, as well as how fast it returns.
